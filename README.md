# Introduction
This is still a prototype.
It is a project to send data from Japanese e-reader+ Pokémon Colosseum Cards on physical hardware without the need to have any type of reader.

### Usage
1. **Place the `.raw` files in `e-cards/raw/`** *(Recommendation: use short filenames for easier processing).*
2. **Run the `Configure.py` script** located in the project root.
3. **Open a terminal in the project root and run `make`** *(You must have devKitARM installed).*
